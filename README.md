# Angular-range-slider
** This package is completely untested! If you find any bugs please report them to me **

An Angular range slider with accessibility. It only supports horizontal mode with one handle. As for now I'm not going to implement vertical mode or two handles as I don't need them.

This should work in IE9+ (And ofc any real browser like Chrome or FF)

## Dependencies
Angular

## What's working:
* Model binding
* Min
* Max
* Step
* Dragging the handle
* Touch supported dragging
* No need to redraw on hide/show or resize
* Aria attributes for a11y
* Keyboard support for a11y

## What's left:
* Clicking on the bar to change value and begin dragging
* SASS support
* Handle bad values in min, max & step
